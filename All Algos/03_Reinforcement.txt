# 📘 Reinforcement Learning – Core Algorithms & Use Cases
# -----------------------------
# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning (RL) involves an agent learning to take actions in an environment
# to maximize cumulative reward over time through trial and error.

# 🔄 Learning is sequential, and feedback is delayed (not instant like supervised learning)

# -----------------------------
# 1️⃣ Value-Based Methods
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Q-Learning              → Off-policy method; learns Q-values for state-action pairs
#                         → Example: Game playing (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, FrozenLake)

# Deep Q-Network (DQN)    → Q-learning + Neural Network as function approximator
#                         → Example: Atari Games, CartPole, FlappyBird

# Double DQN              → Fixes overestimation in DQN
# Dueling DQN             → Separates value and advantage for better stability

# -----------------------------
# 2️⃣ Policy-Based Methods
# -------------------------------------------------------
# REINFORCE (Vanilla Policy Gradient) → Learns policy directly without value function
#                                     → Example: Continuous control, path planning

# Actor-Critic            → Combines policy (actor) and value (critic) learning
# A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)        → Synchronous version
# A3C (Asynchronous Actor-Critic)     → Parallel learning agents (faster convergence)

# -----------------------------
# 3️⃣ Actor-Critic + Deep Learning
# -------------------------------------------------------
# DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)  → For continuous action spaces (e.g., robotics)
# TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG)                   → More stable than DDPG
# SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)                   → High sample efficiency and entropy regularization

# -----------------------------
# 4️⃣ Model-Based RL (Advanced)
# -------------------------------------------------------
# MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)            → Planning via simulations (e.g., AlphaGo)
# World Models / Dreamer                    → Learn environment model + policy

# -----------------------------
# ✅ Summary Table – When to Use What
# -----------------------------
# Q-Learning / DQN          → Discrete action space (e.g., games, simulations)
# DDPG / SAC / TD3          → Continuous action spaces (e.g., robot arm control)
# Actor-Critic (A2C, A3C)   → Balanced performance and efficiency
# Model-Based RL            → When environment is expensive to simulate; planning

# -----------------------------
# 🧠 Typical Use Cases by Industry
# -----------------------------
# Gaming / Simulation       → Training agents to win games (DQN, A3C)
# Robotics                  → Controlling arms, drones (DDPG, SAC)
# Finance                   → Portfolio optimization (Actor-Critic, DDPG)
# Healthcare                → Personalized treatment recommendation
# Supply Chain              → Inventory optimization, dynamic pricing
